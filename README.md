# hello-world
This is my very first GitHub repository. It's time to stop being kind of a old-fashioned and just do the math

I'm pretty sure it'll be a good move to start off with GitHub making all these commiits and pull requests and get rid of slow and old TortoiseSVN.

Next, I'm gonna move all my recent projects here and check out the rest of the features.

Cheers
P.
